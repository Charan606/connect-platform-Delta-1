## Project Description
Scope Match helps students build job‑ready skills using free resources. Students take a short quiz, choose a target role (e.g., Python Developer), and receive personalized learning recommendations curated from YouTube and other free sources. A built‑in progress tracker keeps them motivated as they complete videos and courses.

Platform goals:
- Personalized learning paths from a quick quiz
- Role‑based recommendations (e.g., Python Developer, Data Analyst)
- Curated free resources (YouTube playlists, docs, courses)
- Progress tracking to visualize completion and stay motivated
- Simple, motivating UI focused on skill building

Note: Milestone 1 delivers the public landing page. “For Companies” appears as a placeholder to match rubric requirements.
